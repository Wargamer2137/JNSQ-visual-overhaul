# JNSQ-visual-overhaul

JNSQVO is a performance focused visual overhaul of JNSQ system ,volumetric clouds and parallax continued are supported

# Install instructions 
1.get a fresh install of ksp <br />
2.drop whatever i put into google drive inside your gamedata <br />
3.you are good to go <br />
# trivia and performance considerations 
1.there are two forbidden bodies in the system ,gilly and Riga ,both have some parallax related errors i will work out in the future <br />
2.tested on 16gb ram + gtx 1650 mobile, if you still struggle with fps you can drop texture quality (video settings),increase temporal antialiasing in volumetric settings (eve) or even remove scatteres by clicking parallax icon and setting both range and multi to 0 <br />
3.Pol is spooky on purpose <br />
4.Tylo is most laggy place bc it features athmosphere + reflective surface + scatters <br />
