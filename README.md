# JNSQ-visual-overhaul

JNSQVO is a performance focused visual overhaul of JNSQ system ,volumetric clouds and parallax continued are supported

# Install instructions 
1.get a fresh install of ksp <br />
2.drop whatever provided in google drive link into your game data <br />
3.to ensure you actually paid for parallax and volumetrics i deleted 2 files that you have to get from their authors,these are Parallax_StockTerrainTextures and  StockVolumetricClouds folders  <br />
4.play
# trivia and performance considerations 
1.there are two forbidden bodies in the system ,gilly and Riga ,both have some parallax related errors i will work out in the future <br />

2.tested on 16gb ram + gtx 1650 mobile, if you still struggle with fps you can drop texture quality (video settings),increase temporal antialiasing in volumetric settings (eve) or even remove scatteres by clicking parallax icon and setting both range and multi to 0 <br />

3.Pol lack of scatters is on purpose ,these tree like objects are spooky as fuck <br />

4.Tylo is most laggy place bc it features athmosphere + reflective surface + scatters <br />

5.black overlays on screen? turn of hdr in tufx.

6.ksc has no trees around it ? / its feature both for performance reasons and on some world seeds parallax will grow a forest on your launchpad 

7.some parts of terrain dissapear ,parallax continued wasnt made for 2,7x worlds ,it will either resolve itself in future releases or never
